## Events Application

This application allows users to be able to post their events to the application and let their friends and fellow colleagues see their events that they post. The events that are posted can be anything that the user wants them to be and users can RSVP to the event so the host can know the amount of people that are definetly coming. I have set up an Events log that everytime a user logs in, they are directed to this page so they can see the new events that other users post. With these other posts they can RSVP to the event to let them know that they are coming or they can post an event of their own by hitting the "Create Event" link at the nav bar. Then when the user is done exploring the different events that they want to go too, they can sign-out.

## Planning Story

When I was planning on how to do this project the first thing that I thought of doing was to make a wireframe so I knew exactly what I wanted my application to look like when it was finished. The wireframe gave me a rough idea and eventually I made changes along the way and I was able to use those changes to make a better application. I used the wireframe as a blueprint essentially and then I was able to do my crafting of different pages off of that. The first feature that I did was get the Create to work, once I got the Create Event tab to work then I knew that I could skyrocket from there. I can create events, and then I got all of the events from a single user, then I pulled up a single event and from that screen I was able to make a delete and update button. When the update button was hit, then you would be able to update the information that goes with the event. That is how I approached creating the features of the project.

## User Stories

1. As a User I would like to be able to sign-up and sign-in
2. As a User I would like to be able to Create an event for people to see.
3. As a User I would like to be able to see all of the events that I have posted.
4. As a User I would like to be able to see all of the events that I have RSVP'd too.
5. As a User I would like to be able to see only a single event.
6. As a User I would like to be able to delete an event.
7. As a User I would like to be able to update an event.


## Unsolved Problems

One of my unsolved problems is to be able to get different users to show up on other peoples event logs so they can RSVP to the event that interests them. I would like to be able to invite users to the event. When the invited user clicks on the event, the event will pop up with just the one event so the user can focus on just that event and RSVP to the event if they are interested in going.
